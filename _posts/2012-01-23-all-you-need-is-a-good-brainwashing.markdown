[Classical conditioning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) is underrated. Too many bad spy movies have taught us that 'brainwashing' is bad.

But conditioning can be a&nbsp;powerful&nbsp;tool for self-improvement.&nbsp;I've deliberately been playing the Brian Eno song [Thursday Afternoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Afternoon) every time I felt myself immersed in '[the zone](http://jacquesmattheij.com/living+in+the+zone)'. In my mind, the track and the mental state have now become intricately linked. This is so much the case that I can now descend into productivity Walhalla simply by listening to my personal work anthem.

In effect, I've brainwashed myself to work better in response to a particular tune.

There is nothing special about this trick. Anyone can do it and almost no real effort is required.

A few guidelines.

*   **Choose a song that is long.** Not a two minute ditty. This will also help for the next prerequisite.
*   **Choose a song that can stand to be repeated.** You'll want to be productive for longer than one play.
*   **Choose a song without lyrics.**&nbsp;This is more personal. To me, words and melody are distracting.
*   **Choose a song that is timeless.** Something you wouldn't mind listening to in a few years time.
*   **Choose a song that is not a classic.** Classics are played on the radio. That is not what you want.
*   **Carry your song with you always.** You need to be ready. Productivity can strike at any moment.
*   **Play your song every time you are in the zone.** Especially initially you want the bonding to be strong.
*   **Play your song without interruptions.**&nbsp;Interruptions kill productivity. Interruptions&nbsp;break the spell.
*   **Never play your song when you are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> in the zone.** That would break the spell. Don't do it.
*   **Don't overuse.**&nbsp;There are limits to how productive you can be. This trick does not fix that.
*   **Don't expect magic.** The song will not always work. If it doesn't work, stop listening right away.
