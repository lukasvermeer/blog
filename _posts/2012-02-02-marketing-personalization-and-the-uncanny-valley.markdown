Dear `[prospect.first_name]`,

Following our last discussion on `[prospect.last_contact_date]` concerning `[prospect.subject_area]` I think the following article would be of particular interest to you.

Increased familiarity begets heightened expectations. Personalization has its own [uncanny valley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley).

> The uncanny valley is a hypothesis in the field of robotics and 3D computer animation, which holds that when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among human observers.

When you treat your customers as though you know them personally they will be personally offended if you do not. Beware of the eerie hollow of broken promise.
