At first, the term [Business Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence) (abbr. BI) had me a bit confused. Contrary to my initial interpretation, BI does not concern the mental acuity of corporations or their employees.

**Business**, as in '[From that moment on I had a much better idea as to how I should go about my business.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herakles_(film))'

**Intelligence**, as in '[Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage)'

Rather than '_Corporate IQ_' Business Intelligence should thus be interpreted more like '_Decision Information_'.

We are not trying to make business people smart. We are simply working to give business people the information they need to make informed decisions. 

We are Corporate Ninjas.
