It crossed my mind before, but I never felt I had anything to say. I want that to change.

I've been posting pictures to an abandoned [Livejournal account](http://lukazz.livejournal.com/ "Livejournal account") and [Twittering](http://twitter.com/lukasvermeer "Twittering") for some time now, but lately I'm having trouble compressing all I have to say into just one picture or 140 characters. Time to expand my arsenal of forms of public expression. Time to get bloggin'.
