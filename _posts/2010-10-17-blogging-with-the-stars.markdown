I [started a blog](http://lukasvermeer.wordpress.com/2010/05/04/its-about-time-i-started-a-blog/) because I wanted to improve my writing skills; and thought I had something to say. You, as a reader can help me figure out how I am doing by rating each post (preferably after you've actually read it) on a five star scale.

To give you some guidance I've compiled a summary of how I interpret each star rating.

1.  [Fail](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fail).
2.  [tl;dr](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tl-dr).
3.  [I like turtles](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-like-turtles)! (meh)
4.  [Orly](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/o-rly)? [Om nom nom](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/om-nom-nom-nom)!
5.  [Double Rainbow](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/double-rainbow) / [Over 9000](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/its-over-9000)!!!1111one
Please take the time to consider how you feel about my past and future posts and use the star ratings to let me know. Thanks!

Also, feel free to come up with your own interpretation of the five star scale and share it in the comments.
