In my mind, I write a blog post almost every day. But when I sit down to write, I am at a loss for words.

I have a brain busting with thought, an inbox full of interesting ideas and a stack of draft posts containing loads of links and random ramblings on disparate topics. All this pondering without publication is paralyzing.

Analysis without action is a crippling affliction that affects individuals as well as businesses. Wasting time or wasting money; we all need to be [mindful](https://plus.google.com/106518479241050228896/posts/WYMaW3rMixE) of our conversion rates.

Time to stop thinking and start typing.
