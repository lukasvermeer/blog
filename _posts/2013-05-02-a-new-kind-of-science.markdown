I am no longer a [Corporate Ninja](http://lukasvermeer.wordpress.com/2010/05/07/i-am-a-business-ninja/). As of a few weeks ago I can now call myself "[Data Scientist](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasvermeer) at [Booking.com](http://www.booking.com/)".

Although I am really excited about the new challenges and opportunities that await me in [the sexiest job of the 21st century](http://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century/), I must say this new title bothers me ever so slightly. It somehow seems so redundant.

**If you're not using data, is it really [science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science)?**
