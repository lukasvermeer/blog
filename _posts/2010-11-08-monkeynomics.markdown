Just like with the real coccyx, we should expect to see analogues to the legacy artifacts [discussed in a previous post](http://lukasvermeer.wordpress.com/2010/10/27/a-coccyx-in-the-brain/) in other animals sharing recent evolutionary ancestors with us humans. In other words: monkeys should be as [predictably irrational](http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions/dp/006135323X) as we are; at least in some cases.
