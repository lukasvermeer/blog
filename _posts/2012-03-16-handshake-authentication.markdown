London on a Thursday afternoon. The man sitting a few feet away from me reminds me of that infamous [security guru](http://www.economist.com/node/11090522) whose work I greatly admire; a man who I'd been reading about for years.

Actually, he looks _a lot_ like [Bruce Schneier](http://www.schneier.com/).

But I hesitate; he seems so _normal_. No cohort of press, no masses of screaming fans and no burly bodyguards; if I can muster the courage I can simply walk up to him and ask.

So I did.
> I don't want to be rude, but is it you?
In retrospect, that was probably one of the most moronic questions I have ever put forward to anyone ever. But Bruce seemed unfazed. I probably wasn't the first star-struck geek dazzled by his appearance.
> Yes, I am him.
Completely flabbergasted I mumbled something about that I read his blog. He asked if I had also read [his latest book](http://www.amazon.com/Liars-Outliers-Enabling-Society-Thrive/dp/1118143302). I was ashamed to admit that I had not. Someone took our picture and we shook hands.

He had a pretty firm grip and a mighty powerful handshake; that's when I was certain that this was the man who [already has a backup plan for when a 2nd person discovers that P = NP](http://www.schneierfacts.com/fact/532).

Real-life handshake authentication.
