I'm not really interested in an exposition of your facts. I don't very much care to learn about your reasons.

First, show me your evidence.

Once we've established what you think you've seen, we can talk about what you think it means. Supported by sufficient proof, your theories and derived truths should be much easier to express; sometimes they may even be self-evident.

Then we can both decide what to believe.
