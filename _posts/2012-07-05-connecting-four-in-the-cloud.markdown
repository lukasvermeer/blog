[![Cloud]({{site.baseurl}}{% link assets/2012-07-05-connecting-four-in-the-cloud-clouds.jpg?w=200 %} "Cloud")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lukasvermeer/7081072117/)It almost seems like everyone has their head in [the cloud](https://cloud.oracle.com) these days. And it's not all just hot air and [water vapor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOEFXaWHppE). [Infrastructure as a service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_Service#Service_Models) (IaaS), [platform as a service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (PaaS) and [software as a service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (SaaS) are truly revolutionizing the corporate computing industry.

That is why, for the past few months, my good friend [Matt Feigal](https://twitter.com/#!/mattfgl) and I have been collaborating with budding startup [Cloudular](http://www.ykombinator.com/13144/Cloudular) to bring you the next logical evolutionary step in cloud computing. Inspired by the skyward ascent of hardware, middleware and software, we are proud to bring you vaporized wetware; or "**_artificial intelligence as a service_**" (AIaaS).

I'm mostly kidding, of course, but here is something I cooked up over the weekend. A web service that plays connect four (based on an [earlier post](http://lukasvermeer.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/connect-four-and-minimax/)) and is looking for worthy sparring partners.

If you think you can code a better connect four algorithm (and you probably can, especially since I've deliberately lobotomized this particular version of my implementation), head on over to [github](https://github.com/lukasvermeer/connectfourservice) and build your own to compete against mine. All the code and an interface description are available there. The service itself is available on [Google App Engine](http://connectfourservice.appspot.com/).

I've got (part of) my head in the cloud, what about you?
