![Picture yourself with a new job at: Oracle]({{site.baseurl}}{% link assets/2012-06-05-picture-imprefect-screen-shot-2012-06-05-at-9-39-19-am.png %} "Job Recommendation")

Yes, I can indeed very easily picture myself with a job at Oracle. I hear they are doing some pretty cool stuff [around marketing and personalization](http://www.oracle.com/us/solutions/ent-performance-bi/real-time-decisions-066561.html).

Personalization is difficult. I've written before about [the uncanny valley](http://lukasvermeer.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/marketing-personalization-and-the-uncanny-valley/) where personalized results are so off the mark that they have an adverse effect. The trough of disillusionment where companies pretend to know their customers, but fail to deliver on that promise.

For instance, you would think LinkedIn would know [I already work for Oracle](http://www.linkedin.com/in/lukasvermeer).
